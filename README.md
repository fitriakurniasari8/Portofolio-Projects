#1 Netflix's Data Analysis
About the dataset:  Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 8000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 200M Subscribers globally. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.

In this project, I only analyzed the last decade from the data. I created a report analysis in Google Data Studio.
